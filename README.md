# TYGlaDig
A simulation of cloth done in a modelling project for the course TNM085.

The project dealt with how fabric can be simulated in a realistic manner by calculating how real fabric moves. The equations used in the calculations were determined by modeling a mass-spring damping system where the fabric was represented by several masses that were connected by means of springs and dampers.
